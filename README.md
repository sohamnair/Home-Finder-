About the website: This website is developed keeping the Stevens Institute of Technology's international students in mind. As we have a first hand experience about the problems we faced while searching for a home so keeping that in mind we have developed the feature list accordingly. This website will give the international students a platform to search houses most close to the university. The home owner will list the house with features like location, price, address, etc. The end user(Stevens students) will go through the list by applying several filters like distance(low to high), price(low to high), etc.

Core Features:
1. Used Google Maps API to calculate the distance between the home location and Stevens Institute of Technology.
2. User(Students) Profile: Created when the user creates an account. An account allows the user to save the houses they liked. The user profile shows the user’s details. User’s can also delete their profile.
3. User(Owner) Profile: Created when the user creates an account. An account allows the user to list the house on the platform. The user profile shows the user’s details and the house listings done by them. User’s can not only edit their listing but also delete their profile and any of their listings.
4. Filter-1(Sort by distance): Allows users to sort the houses as per the distance from Stevens.
6. Filter-2(Sort by price): Allows users to sort the houses as per the price(Low to High/High to Low).
7. Filter-3 : Number of Bed and Bath available.
8. Search bar allows user to search by keywords.
9. Comment section allows students and owners to interact with eachother.
